One big thing is if patients come to appointments or not. This can be affected by many things like who they are, what happened before, and how things are set up.\n","\n","Welcome to our \"Healthcare Appointments Analytics\" project. Here, we look at data from medical appointments to find out why patients come or miss appointments. We check things like who the patients are, what happened before, and other important stuff. Our goal is to help healthcare workers make better choices to improve patient care and make things run smoother.\n","\n","But before we start, we have to make sure our data is clean. Sometimes, data has mistakes or missing parts. That's where LangChain comes in. It helps us clean up the data quickly so we can start our analysis.\n","\n","So, join us as we use LangChain and simple language to look at medical appointment data. Together, we'll find out how to make healthcare better for everyone."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"id":"JUtT3DDuzMg3","run_control":{"frozen":true}},"source":["### **Install the required libraries**\n","**langchain**: An open source framework for building applications based on large language models (LLMs).\n","\n","**langchain_experimental**: An experimental extension of the langchain library, offering cutting-edge features and functionalities for advanced natural language processing tasks.\n","\n","**openai**: A powerful Python library developed by OpenAI, offering state-of-the-art natural language processing capabilities.
